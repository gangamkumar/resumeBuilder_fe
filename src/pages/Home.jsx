              Resume Builder is a web application that helps users create
              professional resumes quickly and efficiently using artificial
              intelligence. Traditional resume creation can be time-consuming
              and difficult, especially for freshers who may not know the
              correct format or keywords required for modern recruitment
              systems. <br />
              <br />
              The system can suggest job-specific keywords, professional
              summaries, and skill recommendations to make the resume more
              effective and ATS (Applicant Tracking System) friendly. <br />
              <br />
              The main goal of the Resume Builder is to simplify the resume
              creation process and help job seekers build professional,
              well-structured resumes in a few minutes. Users can edit content,
              preview their resume, and download it in formats such as PDF.
              <br />
              <br />
              This type of system is especially useful for students & fresh
              graduates, who want to create high-quality resumes that increase
              their chances of getting shortlisted for job interviews.
